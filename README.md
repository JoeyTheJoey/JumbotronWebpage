This project was created to used by all Launch Family Entertainment corporate and franchisee locations.

The purpose of the project is to create an easy way to display a webpage to Launch jumbotrons. The primary use of the webpage is to let patrons know when their allotted trampoline time is over. Patrons who have purchased trampoline time will be given a colored wristband corresponding to the amount of time they have paid for. The webpage follows a schedule followed by all parks nationwide. The three colors displayed are those closest to being depleted according to the schedule and will be reset once their timer reaches zero.

The webpage will automatically find the correct timezone to display the time at the bottom of the page. There are plans to routinely play promotional audio cues .

Park employees will ensure the webpage is displayed on the Jumbotron when the park opens.
